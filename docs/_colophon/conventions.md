## Special Blockquotes

Blockquotes in markdown are indicated by starting the line(s) of text with the greater-than symbol: `>`.

> TIP: Special stylings can be applied to blockquotes that begin with either *TIP:*, *NOTE:*, *WARNING:*, or *BETA:*. The styling is achieved through JavaScript, CSS and FontAwesome icons.

Here are some examples.

> TIP: This blockquote starts with `TIP:`.

> NOTE: This blockquote starts with `NOTE:`.
